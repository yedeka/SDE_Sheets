1] Reversing a linked list - Remeber to start with prev = null and current = head.
2] Find middle of the linked list - Use slow and fast pointer strategy and return the slow pointer.
3] Merge two sorted lists.
4] Remove Nth node from end of the linked list - Use 2 pointer approach by increasing one pointer by N.
Then run both the pointers by one counter and when the pointer that is ahead becomes null remove the node pointed by the behind pointer.
