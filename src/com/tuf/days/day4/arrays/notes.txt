1] 2 sum
2] 4 sum
3] Longest consecutive sequence in an array - Can be done in 3 ways
Brute force O(N^2) solution.
Make a set and check in the set for each element.
Use the formula (max-min) = i - j
Basically iterate over the array to find out min and max and the moment you have max - min = gap of indices we will have all the elements.
4] Length of longest subarray with 0 sum -
Brute Force appraoch -
This can be done in O(n^2) ways by running a nested for loop of i = 0..n-2 amnd j = i+1...n-1 and checking for every possible subarray.
Optimal Solution -
Whilre iterating through array calculate the prefix sum of the array.
The index at which prefix sum gets repeated is the subarray of zero sum.
Intution - prefix repeating at an index indicates that the sum of middle elements of subarray is cancelling itself.
