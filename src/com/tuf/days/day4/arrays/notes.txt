1] 2 sum
2] 4 sum
3] Longest consecutive sequence in an array - Can be done in 3 ways
Brute force O(N^2) solution.
Make a set and check in the set for each element.
Use the formula (max-min) = i - j
Basically iterate over the array to find out min and max and the moment you have max - min = gap of indices we will have all the elements.
